## Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I will then try out the model on images of German traffic signs that I find on the web.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dataset

The dataset is provided by CarND. It's a pickled dataset which have been already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.

### Result
Check the [writeup](https://github.com/kevingau/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project/blob/master/writeup.md) for more result detail.
